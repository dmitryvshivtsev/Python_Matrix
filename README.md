# Python Matrix

This project was created for help to myself understand OOP principles.

**Methods:**
* `eq_matrix(other_matrix)`
* `sum_matrix(other_matrix)`
* `sub_matrix(other_matrix)`
* `mul_number(number)`
* `transpose()`
* `determinant()`
* `calc_complements()`
* `inverse_matrix()`
* `print_matrix()`
* `random_fill_matrix()`

To run the tests, run the `make test` command

**Docker:**

This project uses Docker for training purposes. Inside the container, the unit tests are simply run.
